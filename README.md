# PIIQUANTE 

PIIQUANTE is a backend API construction project for HOT TAKES, a sauce gallery that enables users to upload their favorite hot sauces and like or dislike sauces shared by others. The project aims to develop an API according to the provided specifications in the brief. To run the backend and frontend separately, follow the installation instructions provided.

## Installation

1. Clone the API repository into a backend folder, then do the same for the frontend repository provided in a frontend folder, both separately in your main directory as follows: `mainDirectory/backend & mainDirectory/frontend`.
2. To launch the backend, navigate to the directory and open a terminal, then run the following command: `npm install`
3. To start the API, execute the following command: nodemon server
4. To launch the frontend, execute the following commands: `npm install` followed by `npm start`.

The API will allow users to manage their own sauces, like or dislike other users' sauces, and moderate the content by deleting inappropriate or offensive sauces. The backend will use Node.js and Express.js to create a RESTful API, and MongoDB for data storage.

To start the backend, navigate to the repository directory and run "npm install". Then, execute "nodemon server" to start the server. For the frontend, also run "npm install" and then "npm start".

This project evaluates skills in event handling, data validation, test planning, web service interaction, and adherence to functional and technical specifications. By completing this project, developers will have gained valuable experience in building a full-stack application and integrating a backend API with a frontend.
